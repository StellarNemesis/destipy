destipy
========

Access Destiny's public API using Python.

# To Run

Currently destipy looks for two files in the destipy directory where "bungo_db.py" is located. These need to be added manually.
- "dest_sql.content" Bungie's SQL database
- "api_key.txt" This is where you need to put your API key

# todo

- Add inventory and glimmer
- Make all variable names more consistent with api (maybe)
- Do the rest of the api
- Search for/cache the weekly/nightfall hashes until reset
- Add more examples/refine current examples
- Add Trials of Osiris report type thing
- ~~Add login to PSN~~
- Add login to Xbox Live
- Add way to auto download and unzip Bungie's SQL file
- Figure out how item talent nodes/perks work and implement
- Add test to see if API key is valid
